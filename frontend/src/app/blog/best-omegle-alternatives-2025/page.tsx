              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-6">What Made Omegle Popular?</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Before diving into alternatives, it's worth understanding what made Omegle so popular. Launched in 2009, Omegle pioneered the concept of anonymous random chat. It was simple, required no registration, and connected you instantly with strangers worldwide. The platform's tagline, "Talk to strangers!" captured the essence of spontaneous, unfiltered human connection.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                However, Omegle also had significant drawbacks: limited moderation, privacy concerns, and a reputation for inappropriate content. Modern alternatives have learned from these issues, implementing better safety features while maintaining the core appeal of random connection.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-6">Test Multiple Platforms</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Don't limit yourself to one platform. Try several alternatives to see which feels most comfortable. Each platform has its own culture and user base, and what works for others might not work for you.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4 mt-6">Read User Reviews</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Check recent reviews on app stores, Reddit, and other forums. Look for patterns in complaints and praise. A platform with consistent positive reviews about safety and user experience is likely a good choice.
